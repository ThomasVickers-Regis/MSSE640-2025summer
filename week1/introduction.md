## Thomas Vickers

Hello everyone,

My name is Thomas Vickers, and I am currently residing in New Mexico, where I relocated to pursue a career opportunity with the federal government. I bring several years of professional experience in software engineering, having worked with both start-up companies and medium-sized organizations across various industries.

In my current role, I provide comprehensive network support and maintenance services, ensuring optimal performance, security, and reliability of critical infrastructure systems. My professional background includes extensive network engineering experience, having served in military communications and supported various organizations throughout the Denver, Colorado metropolitan area.

Additionally, I have contributed to the energy sector through gas and electric distribution engineering projects during my tenure in Denver. Software engineering has been my primary professional passion and area of expertise, and I am continuously developing my technical skills with the long-term goal of launching my own innovative software application.

I look forward to collaborating with all of you throughout this course and contributing to meaningful discussions on software security and engineering best practices.

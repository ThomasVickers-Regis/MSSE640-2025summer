# Week 6 Test Case Analysis: State Transitions

## Section 1: Introduction
State transition testing is a black-box test design technique used to test systems that exhibit different behaviors based on their current state and the events or inputs they receive. This technique is particularly valuable for systems with complex state-dependent logic, such as user authentication systems, e-commerce workflows, game mechanics, or any application where the system's response depends not just on the current input, but also on its previous state and the sequence of events that led to that state.

The fundamental concept behind state transition testing is that a system can exist in various states, and transitions between these states occur based on specific events or conditions. Each state has defined behaviors and valid transitions to other states. By systematically testing these state transitions, we can verify that the system behaves correctly under all possible state-event combinations and that invalid transitions are properly handled.

State transition testing is especially effective for identifying defects related to state management, such as improper state changes, missing state validations, or incorrect behavior when the system is in unexpected states. This technique helps ensure that the system maintains data integrity and provides consistent behavior across all possible state scenarios.

## Section 2: Table/Diagram with Example Data
Below is an example of state transition testing for an online shopping cart system:

**Scenario:** Testing the state transitions of a shopping cart in an e-commerce application.

**States:**
- Empty: Cart contains no items  
- Has Items: Cart contains one or more items  
- Checkout: User has initiated the checkout process  
- Payment: User is entering payment information  
- Confirmed: Order has been successfully placed  
- Cancelled: Order has been cancelled  

**Events:**
- Add Item: User adds a product to the cart  
- Remove Item: User removes a product from the cart  
- Start Checkout: User begins the checkout process  
- Enter Payment: User proceeds to payment  
- Confirm Order: User completes the purchase  
- Cancel Order: User cancels the order  
- Clear Cart: User removes all items  

**State Transition Table:**

| Current State | Event | Next State | Expected Action |
|---------------|-------|------------|-----------------|
| Empty | Add Item | Has Items | Add product to cart, update total |
| Empty | Start Checkout | Empty | Show error: "Cart is empty" |
| Empty | Remove Item | Empty | Show error: "No items to remove" |
| Has Items | Add Item | Has Items | Add product to cart, update total |
| Has Items | Remove Item | Has Items/Empty | Remove product, update total |
| Has Items | Start Checkout | Checkout | Display checkout form |
| Has Items | Clear Cart | Empty | Remove all items, reset total |
| Checkout | Enter Payment | Payment | Display payment form |
| Checkout | Cancel Order | Has Items | Return to cart view |
| Payment | Confirm Order | Confirmed | Process payment, send confirmation |
| Payment | Cancel Order | Has Items | Return to cart view |
| Confirmed | Add Item | Empty | Clear previous order, start new cart |
| Confirmed | Start Checkout | Empty | Show error: "Previous order completed" |
| Cancelled | Add Item | Has Items | Start new cart session |

**State Diagram:**

[Empty] --Add Item--> [Has Items] --Start Checkout--> [Checkout] --Enter Payment--> [Payment] --Confirm Order--> [Confirmed]

## Section 3: When Should This Type of Testing Be Used
State transition testing should be used when a system's behavior changes depending on its current state and prior interactions. It is particularly effective for applications involving sequential workflows, authentication processes, multi-step transactions, or systems with strict business rules tied to user actions. It is also useful when invalid inputs or events can occur in specific states, requiring error handling. Systems such as banking applications, vending machines, and online checkout processes benefit greatly from this method because they involve multiple dependent states and transitions.

## Section 4: Limitations of the Methodology
While state transition testing is powerful for systems with complex state logic, it can be time-consuming when the number of states and events grows large. In some cases, exhaustive testing of every state-event combination becomes impractical, especially for systems with high complexity. Additionally, if the state model is incomplete or incorrect, the resulting test coverage will be misleading, leaving potential defects undiscovered. This method also requires testers to have a detailed understanding of the system's internal state design, which may not always be documented.

## Section 5: References or Discussion About AI Tool
For this assignment, I used ChatGPT to draft and structure the explanation, table, and scenarios for state transition testing.

1. **Did it hallucinate?**  
   No significant hallucinations occurred. The provided examples were logically consistent with real-world scenarios and aligned with standard definitions of state transition testing.

2. **Site used to verify validity of GenAI output:**

3. **One prompt used:**  
   *"Create a simple but clear example of a State Transition for a software testing scenario. The scenario should be easy to understand"*
